                Precision Agriculture has been around for over two decades. The first decade had a strong focus on quantifying spatial variability in soils, the second decade spent significant time on science and technology of precision management of nutrients. Now, with increasing adoption of Precision management techniques and practices there is interest in harnessing the power of data to grapple the new paradigm of making management decision based on evidence. The success of future farming practices, output, efficiency and sustainability, would rely heavily on “farming the data” as much as “farming the land”. This presentation will empower the audience with research based information on how precision agriculture is embracing information and communication technologies and numerous aspects of big-data to transform agronomy and crop production systems. This presentation will include examples of where big-data has been pivotal in addressing agronomic challenges as well the greater role big-data can play in enhancing our understanding of variability in crops and soil properties as well as analyzing spatially dependent datasets to make highly accurate and timely agronomic decisions.

<div class="card-body"> <p class="card-text">The Canadian System of Soil Classification (CSSC) was last updated in 1998, managed largely by AAFC. Federal expertise in soil classification has declined significantly, coinciding with increased activity in the private sector. With this shift, the process for updating the CSSC has become unclear. The Pedology Committee was asked to take responsibility for the CSSC and in 2011 produced a Special Edition of the Canadian Journal of Soil Science dedicated to soil taxonomy. At the 2019 CSSS meeting, the Pedology Committee proposed to take ownership of the CSSC and develop a technical committee to oversee the update of the CSSC and the eventual release of the 4th edition. The Soil Taxonomy and Advances in Pedology Session will provide the opportunity for pedologists to develop technical presentations that outline proposed changes to the CSSC. Although the primary focus of the session will be to advance work towards a 4th edition of the CSSC, the session will also provide a venue for pedological research to be highlighted. Advances in pedometrics and morphometrics, specifically proximal sensing for soil horizon delineation, morphological descriptions, and prediction of soil properties would be encouraged.</p>

<div class="card-body"> <p class="card-text">Focusing the proposed session on the “Awareness and Competency in Soil Science Education” speaks to the importance that soil scientists place on the teaching and training of students to prepare them for rewarding careers in industry, government and academia. With an evident shift in Canadian postsecondary education, from teaching soil science to students who major in the subject to those majoring in other disciplines, we are challenged to teach the necessary content and rigor to students from a broad range of disciplines, and prepare them for careers that require soil science skills and knowledge. The objective of this session is to share experiences and strategies that have been effective in engaging students from environmental sciences, resource management, geography, biology, and geology; students who want to include soils skills and knowledge in their toolbox, but have not yet felt the passion we do for our discipline.</p>

<div class="card-body"> <p class="card-text">This session focuses on the impacts of agroecological farming practices on soil health and functioning, within a Canadian context. Topics of soil health can include, nutrient retention and chemical cycling, stability, microbial diversity, water retention, recovery from soil contamination etc.
Agroecological practices have been heralded as a way to improve soil fertility, reduce soil erosion, mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and protect biological and genetic diversity. These practices can take many forms, including intercropping, agroforestry, crop rotation, no-till practices, all with varying levels of farmer engagement, intensity and scale. By understanding the underlying mechanisms which govern soil functioning, we can make more informed and evidence-based decisions on how to transform agricultural landscapes from common conventional to diverse agroecological. Can diversified crop systems improve soil fertility? What are regenerative soil practices? How do low input practices impact soil health and greenhouse gas emissions? What are the environmental and economic benefits or disadvantages of agroecological practices as related to soil health?

<div class="card-body"> <p class="card-text">There is a great history in Canada of long-term research on best management practices for agricultural production. Often the questions at the time these plots were established are less pertinent today, but the long-term results remain relevant. Through curiosity and necessity, the research questions pursued on these sites has shifted over the decades. Today, as we grapple with climate change and an increasing population, the public is taking a more active interest in soil management practices for food production. Soil health is the new lens through which best management practices are being assessed. Soil health is when soils function as a vital living ecosystem that sustain plants, animals, and humans. However, the soil properties and processes that underpin soil function are numerous, complex, dynamic, non-independent, and occur across a variety of time scales – some decadal. Therefore, long-term studies are well-positioned to inform best management practices for maintaining soil health and food production. This session will explore how the rich history of agricultural research in Canada can help answer the urgent questions of today. This session welcomes contributions that synthesize long-term research results from sites across Canada that can help inform our understanding of best management practices for sustainable food production. Contributions from across the food production spectrum, for example, rangeland, horticulture, or grain production systems, are welcome.</p>

<div class="card-body"> <p class="card-text">Belowground organisms play a key role in numerous processes of critical interest, such as carbon cycling, nutrient dynamics, or plant productivity. However, disturbances may disrupt these communities and their associated functions. With changing patterns of natural disturbances, such as wildfires or extreme weather events, and new anthropogenic disturbances, such as the introduction of soil contaminants or invasive species, it is essential to understand how disturbances affect soil organisms. The goal of this proposed session is to bring together soil biology research in the context of disturbance in natural ecosystems. We will solicit research on all types of belowground soil organisms, including fungi, bacteria, archaea, small eukaryotes, viruses, and soil fauna. We will welcome research in a diversity of natural systems, such as forests, grasslands, or tundra, and will aim to have representation from as wide a range of ecosystems in Canada as possible. Within these systems, we will consider natural as well as anthropogenic soil disturbances, such as wildfire, species invasions, industrial contamination, or extreme weather events. We will encourage research that is framed within the context of ecological theory, as well as studies that include functional measurements in addition to community composition data. We anticipate that the session will be of interest to a diverse set of researchers from across Canada.</p>

<div class="card-body"> <p class="card-text">Awareness of soils and their importance in delivering key ecosystem services has increased over the last few decades. Soil faunal and microbial communities are known to provide vital regulating services that impact carbon sequestration, air and water quality, erosion control, and nutrient cycling. However, linking biological soil attributes to soil health and ecosystem services remains a major challenge. Therefore, knowing how land management practices affect the biological component and how to manage the soil resource for specific services remains elusive. This cross-disciplinary session will explore methods for linking soil organisms to ecosystem services across all ecosystems and land uses (forestry, agriculture, reclamation, urban environments). Topics may include: new methods for assessing the soil biotic community and linking the results to soil processes, soil functions, or ecosystem services; refining recent methods to enhance their utility; or applying traditional techniques to the evolving perspective on soil health and ecosystem services.</p>

Soil sciences have contributed to the delivery of metrics but more needs to be done to build public understanding of today’s food and farming systems. This session will focus on projects aimed at linking the management of crop nutrition to outcomes including productivity, soil health, nutrient use efficiency, air and water quality, and carbon balance.</p>
